# Enabling the BlueBubbles Private API

To use advanced features like **Tapbacks (Reactions)**, **Group Renames**, and **Mark as Read**, you must enable the Private API on your Mac Mini.

### 1. Open settings
1.  Open the **BlueBubbles** desktop app on your Mac Mini.
2.  Click the **Settings** (gear) icon in the bottom-left.

### 2. Enable Private API
1.  Scroll down to the **Private API** section.
2.  Toggle **Enable Private API** to **ON**.

### 3. Verification
1.  Once enabled, Jarvis will be able to react to messages and manage your group chats instantly.
2.  If you see an error about the "Helper app," ensure you have installed the **BlueBubbles Helper** (the app usually prompts you to install it when you toggle the setting).

*Note: This setting is required for BlueBubbles to interact directly with the macOS iMessage database for these features.*
